Update Gant Chart for second sprint

**Architectural design.**

o quality control deve rodar ou ent devemos meter no relatorio que Ã© feito por todos

 Context diagram: use a Block Definition Diagram (BDD) linking actors to the system as a black box.

- Use case view: A Use Case diagram for all the features (5 basic + 4 chosen + 1 new). 
    - Member: All

-  Logical view: use a Block diagram to show the decomposition of the system for all the features (5 basic + 4 chosen + 1 new), including interface, control and domain objects. 
    - Member: All

-  Process View: Sequence diagrams only for the 4 features chosen + 1 new.
    Member: All excepts Guilherme

-  Development view: Use BDD to organize the systems into subsystems and internal block diagrams (IBD) for each subsystem showing how the subsystem parts are connected.  
    - Member: Guilherme

-  Deployment view: Use BDD to show the allocation of subsystems blocks  to machines and servers blocks. Use IBD to show how the machine blocks are connected.

-  Justify how the NFRs are satisfied and which architectural patterns are used.

**Prototype**
- Deliver the protype to validate all the system features (5 basic + 4 chosen + 1 new).
    - 4 chosen:
        -  User-reported incidents
        - Integration with Spotify and other apps
        - Voice-guided navigation
        - Point of interest finder
    
    - new feature:
        - Program Route with several stops

    

**Variability modelling.**
- Think the MyWaze as a Software Product Line (SPL) by building a feature model to represent the commonalities and variabilities for different  configurations. 
Have as the basis the 15 initial feature from the 1st Sprint and add new features. 

- Configure 2 possible applications. 

**Gantt chart updated and a burndown chart for the 2nd Sprint.**
